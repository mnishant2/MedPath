 6.1 Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
 The efficacy and safety of AFINITOR (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n=485) versus placebo plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n=239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 28-93 years), and 75% were Caucasian. Safety results are based on a median follow-up of approximately 13 months.
 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, decreased potassium, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia.
 Fatal adverse reactions occurred more frequently in patients who received AFINITOR plus exemestane (2%) compared to patients on the placebo plus exemestane arm (0.4%). The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation were 24% and 5% for the AFINITOR plus exemestane and placebo plus exemestane treatment groups, respectively. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) were more frequent among patients in the AFINITOR plus exemestane arm than in the placebo plus exemestane arm (63% versus 14%).
 Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR 10 mg daily versus placebo.

 6.2 Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
 In a randomized, controlled trial of AFINITOR (n=204) versus placebo (n=203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (range 20-87), 79% were Caucasian, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label AFINITOR upon disease progression.
 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 50%) were decreased hemoglobin, hyperglycemia, alkaline phosphatase increased, hypercholesterolemia, bicarbonate decreased, and increased aspartate transaminase (AST). The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, decreased hemoglobin, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), potassium decreased, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse event was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on AFINITOR and one patient on placebo. Causes of death on the AFINITOR arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. There was one death due to pulmonary embolism on the placebo arm. After cross-over to open-label AFINITOR, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation were 20% and 6% for the AFINITOR and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus patients and 29% of placebo patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus arm and three patients in the placebo arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus arm and one in the placebo arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus arm and two in the placebo arm.

 6.3 Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
 The data described below reflect exposure to AFINITOR (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 27-85), 88% were Caucasian, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (range 19-451 days) for patients receiving AFINITOR and 60 days (range 21-295 days) for those receiving placebo.
 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the AFINITOR arm but none on the placebo arm. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (irrespective of causality) resulting in permanent discontinuation were 14% and 3% for the AFINITOR and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (irrespective of causality) leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during AFINITOR treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.

 Longer-term follow-up of 34.2 months (range 4.7 to 47.1 months) from a non-randomized, open-label, 28-patient trial resulted in the following additional notable adverse reactions and key laboratory abnormalities: cellulitis (29%), hyperglycemia (25%), and elevated creatinine (14%).
 6.6 Postmarketing Experience
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AFINITOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, arterial thrombotic events and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2"> 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 EXCERPT: * Non-infectious pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes; fatal cases have occurred. Manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve, and consider use of corticosteroids. (5.1)
 * Infections: Increased risk of infections, some fatal. Monitor for signs and symptoms, and treat promptly. (5.2)
 * Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (5.3)
 * Oral ulceration: Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis are common. Management includes mouthwashes and topical treatments. (5.4)
 * Renal failure: Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed. (5.5)
 * Impaired wound healing: Increased risk of wound-related complications. Monitor signs and symptoms. Exercise caution in the peri-surgical period. (5.6)
 * Laboratory test alterations: Elevations of serum creatinine, urinary protein, blood glucose, and lipids may occur. Decreases in hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets may also occur. Monitor renal function, blood glucose, lipids, and hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. (5.8)
 * Vaccinations: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. (5.11)
 * Embryo-fetal toxicity: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of potential harm to the fetus. (5.12, 8.1)
 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis
 Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including AFINITOR. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR in clinical trials. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. Fatal outcomes have been observed.
 Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.
 Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue AFINITOR therapy without dose alteration. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.
 If symptoms are moderate, consider interrupting therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. AFINITOR may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered [see Table 1 in Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
 For cases of Grade 3 non-infectious pneumonitis interrupt AFINITOR until resolution to less than or equal to Grade 1. AFINITOR may be re-introduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered depending on the individual clinical circumstances [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If toxicity recurs at Grade 3, consider discontinuation of AFINITOR. For cases of Grade 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue AFINITOR. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.
 5.2 Infections
 AFINITOR has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, or pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) or fatal. Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with AFINITOR. Complete treatment of pre-existing invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment with AFINITOR. While taking AFINITOR, be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection; if a diagnosis of an infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of AFINITOR. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue AFINITOR and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.
 Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, some with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received everolimus. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis for PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.
 5.3 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors
 Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor.
 5.4 Oral Ulceration
 Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR at an incidence ranging from 44%-78% across the clinical trial experience. Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis was reported in 4%-9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. In such cases, topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing mouthwashes should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 5.5 Renal Failure
 Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with AFINITOR [see Laboratory Tests and Monitoring (5.8)].
 5.6 Impaired Wound Healing
 Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR in the peri-surgical period.
 5.7 Geriatric Patients
 In the randomized advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study, the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients &gt;= 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients &gt;= 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
 5.8 Laboratory Tests and Monitoring
 Renal Function
 Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter. Renal function of patients should be monitored particularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.
 Blood Glucose and Lipids
 Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose and lipid profile is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter as well as management with appropriate medical therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended when AFINITOR is co-administered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on AFINITOR.
 Hematologic Parameters
 Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter.
 5.9 Drug-drug Interactions
 Due to significant increases in exposure of everolimus, co-administration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 A reduction of the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 An increase in the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].
 5.10 Hepatic Impairment
 Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 For advanced HR+ BC, advanced PNET, advanced RCC, and renal angiomyolipoma with TSC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), AFINITOR may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk. For patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 For patients with SEGA and mild or moderate hepatic impairment, adjust the dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ based on therapeutic drug monitoring. For patients with SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ by approximately 50% and adjust subsequent doses based on therapeutic drug monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)].
 5.11 Vaccinations
 During AFINITOR treatment, avoid the use of live vaccines and avoid close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines).
 For pediatric patients with SEGA that do not require immediate treatment, complete the recommended childhood series of live virus vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate.
 5.12 Embryo-fetal Toxicity
 Based on the mechanism of action, AFINITOR can cause fetal harm. Everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in animals at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception while using AFINITOR and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
