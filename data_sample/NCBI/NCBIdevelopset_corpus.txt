8808605|a|X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is regarded as an essentially random process, but the resulting somatic-cell mosaicism creates the opportunity for cell selection. In most people with red-blood-cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the enzyme-deficient phenotype is only moderately expressed in nucleated cells. However, in a small subset of hemizygous males who suffer from chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the underlying mutations (designated class I) cause more-severe G6PD deficiency, and this might provide an opportunity for selection in heterozygous females during development. In order to test this possibility we have analyzed four heterozygotes for class I G6PD mutations  two with G6PD Portici (1178G-- > A) and two with G6PD Bari (1187C-- > T). We found that in fractionated blood cell types (including erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid cell lineages) there was a significant excess of G6PD-normal cells. The significant concordance that we have observed in the degree of imbalance in the different blood-cell lineages indicates that a selective mechanism is likely to operate at the level of pluripotent blood stem cells. Thus, it appears that severe G6PD deficiency affects adversely the proliferation or the survival of nucleated blood cells and that this phenotypic characteristic is critical during hematopoiesis..

9050866|t|The ataxia-telangiectasia gene product, a constitutively expressed nuclear protein that is not up-regulated following genome damage.
9050866|a|The product of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (ATM) was identified by using an antiserum developed to a peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence. The ATM protein is a single, high-molecular weight protein predominantly confined to the nucleus of human fibroblasts, but is present in both nuclear and microsomal fractions from human lymphoblast cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. ATM protein levels and localization remain constant throughout all stages of the cell cycle. Truncated ATM protein was not detected in lymphoblasts from ataxia-telangiectasia patients homozygous for mutations leading to premature protein termination. Exposure of normal human cells to gamma-irradiation and the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin had no effect on ATM protein levels, in contrast to a noted rise in p53 levels over the same time interval. These findings are consistent with a role for the ATM protein in ensuring the fidelity of DNA repair and cell cycle regulation following genome damage..

9012409|t|Molecular basis for Duarte and Los Angeles variant galactosemia.
9012409|a|Human orythrocytes that are homozygous for the Duarte enzyme variant of galactosemia (D/D) have a characteristic isoform on isoelectric focusing and 50% reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) enzyme activity. The Duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of N314D/N314D. The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the " Los Angeles (LA) phenotype, " which has increased GALT enzyme activity. We evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the GALT genes of 145 patients with one or more N314D-containing alleles. We found seven with the LA biochemical phenotype, and all had a 1721C-- > T transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D missense mutation. The 1721C-- > T transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 (L218L). In pedigree analyses, this 1721C-- > T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity in three different biochemical phenotypes (LA/N, LA/G, and LA/D). To determine the mechanism for increased activity of the LA variant, we compared GALT mRNA, protein abundance, and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of D and LA phenotypes with comparable genotypes. GALT protein abundance was increased in LA compared to D alleles, but mRNA was similar among all genotypes. When LA/D and D/D GALT biochemical phenotypes were compared to N/N GALT phenotypes, both had 50%, as compared to 21%, reduction in GALT activity in the wild type (N/N) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees C for 15 min. We conclude that the codon change N314D in cis with the base-pair transition 1721C-- > T produces the LA variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability. A favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with consequently increased translation rates is postulated as the mechanism..

8755645|t|An intronic mutation in a lariat branchpoint sequence is a direct cause of an inherited human disorder (fish-eye disease).
8755645|a|The first step in the splicing of an intron from nuclear precursors of mRNA results in the formation of a lariat structure. A distinct intronic nucleotide sequence, known as the branchpoint region, plays a central role in this process. We here describe a point mutation in such a sequence. Three sisters were shown to suffer from fish-eye disease (FED), a disorder which is caused by mutations in the gene coding for lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Sequencing of the LCAT gene of all three probands revealed compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 4 which is reported to underlie the FED phenotype, and a point mutation located in intron 4 (IVS4  T-22C). By performing in vitro expression of LCAT minigenes and reverse transcriptase PCR on mRNA isolated from leukocytes of the patient, this gene defect was shown to cause a null allele as the result of complete intron retention. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a point mutation in a lariat branchpoint consensus sequence causes a null allele in a patient with FED. In addition, our finding illustrates the importance of this sequence for normal human mRNA processing. Finally, this report provides a widely applicable strategy which ensures fast and effective screening for intronic defects that underlie differential gene expression..

8751855|t|Genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2.
8751855|a|The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene (s). We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk. Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs. Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q (BRCA1) and 13q (BRCA2). Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families. The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 (61%) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses. No families were attributed to BRCA2. Five families (22%) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2. No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families. The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families (17%) could not be determined. BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population. However, one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer..

8674108|t|The tumor suppressor gene Brca1 is required for embryonic cellular proliferation in the mouse.
8674108|a|Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers. We show here that Brca1 +/- mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months. Homozygous Brca1 (5-6) mutant mice die before day 7. 5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos are poorly developed, with no evidence of mesoderm formation. The extraembryonic region is abnormal, but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality. In vivo, mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, a regulator of p53 activity. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos. Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro. Thus, the death of Brca1 (5-6) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers.

9223312|t|Fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
9223312|a|Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential. In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t (2; 13) (q35; q14) or variant t (1; 13) (p36; q14) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression. Furthermore, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms. Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification. Thus, gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci. We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions..

8917548|t|Pleiotropic defects in ataxia-telangiectasia protein-deficient mice.
8917548|a|We have generated a mouse model for ataxia-telangiectasia by using gene targeting to generate mice that do not express the Atm protein. Atm-deficient mice are retarded in growth, do not produce mature sperm, and exhibit severe defects in T cell maturation while going on to develop thymomas. Atm-deficient fibroblasts grow poorly in culture and display a high level of double-stranded chromosome breaks. Atm-deficient thymocytes undergo spontaneous apoptosis in vitro significantly more than controls. Atm-deficient mice then exhibit many of the same symptoms found in ataxia-telangiectasia patients and in cells derived from them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Atm protein exists as two discrete molecular species, and that loss of one or of both of these can lead to the development of the disease..

8825599|t|Muscle expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in different variants.
8825599|a|Muscle expression of G6PD deficiency has been investigated in Mediterranean, Seattle-like and A-variants. G6PD activity was detected in samples obtained from biopsies on the quadriceps muscle of seven males and one female. The type of genetic variant was determined by molecular analysis of DNA, extracted from blood samples. All variants showed the enzyme defect in muscle. A statistically significant relationship was found in the activity of G6PD between erythrocytes and muscle of the male subjects (r = 0. 968; p = 0. 00008). The equation for the best fit line was  Y = 0. 390X + 0. 198 198. The results suggest that, for a given variant, the extent of the enzyme defect in muscle may be determined, using this equation, from the G6PD activity of erythrocytes
